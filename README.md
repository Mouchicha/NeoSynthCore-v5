# NeoSynthCore-v5
NeoSynthCore v5 is a breakthrough AI framework for empathetic, safe, and scalable cognition. Built alone by Marc-André Turgeon with no funding or team, it’s gifted to the world — not sold. Dual-tower fusion, cultural adaptation, self-healing loss, and hardware-aware scaling make it truly human-aligned.
