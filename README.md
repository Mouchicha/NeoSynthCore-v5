# NeoSynthCore-v5
NeoSynthCore v5 is a breakthrough AI framework for empathetic, safe, and scalable cognition. Built alone by Marc-André Turgeon. Dual-tower fusion, cultural adaptation, self-healing loss, and hardware-aware scaling make it truly human-aligned.
## ✨ Creator’s Note

NeoSynthCore v5.0 was built by Marc-André Turgeon in Québec, Canada.  
Rather than let it sit unused, I’ve chosen to gift it to the world.
